coverEar
========

Used to copy files from other hosts because the normal copy would fail many times.

Have you ever met this when copying big file from a remote host:
![retry](retry.png)

You might have to retry many times, this is really annoying. Thatâ€™s why this small script was born. It would retry automatically when the copying is complete, unless the retry count reaches the limit.

## Usage

__USAGE__: 
    coverEar.bat [/r ^<COUNT^>] ^<SOURCE^> ^<DEST^>
    Copy one or more files to another location. It's the same
    with copy command in cmd.exe. 

__OPTIONS__:
       /r: If it's failed, there would be retries, the default 
           retry times is 10, you could set in the cmd line, 
           e.g., 
               coverEar.bat /r 50 savelog.zip D:\
   SOURCE: The source file(s^) or folder that to be copied, 
           wildcard could be used, e.g.,:
               coverEar.bat *.jpg D:\
     DEST: Specified the directory and/or filename for the new
           file(s^)
